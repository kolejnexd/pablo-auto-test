## First 5 Minutes After a Breakdown – Safety Guide

A breakdown on the A2 motorway (Südautobahn) is a stressful situation. It is important to stay calm and follow safety rules. Traffic on this route is heavy, so every second counts for your safety and the safety of other road users.

1. **Turn on hazard lights** – signal the problem to other drivers immediately.
2. **Move to the hard shoulder** – if possible, stop the car as close to the barrier as possible.
3. **Put on a reflective vest** – in Austria, this is mandatory for anyone exiting the car.
4. **Exit the vehicle safely** – always from the passenger side (right side), never onto the roadway!
5. **Set up the warning triangle** – at least 150 meters behind the vehicle.
6. **Take cover behind the crash barrier** – never wait inside the car for roadside assistance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Safety First:** Do not try to repair the car on the driving lane. If the car stopped in the left lane, turn on hazards and leave the vehicle as soon as it is safe, escaping to the median strip or behind the barrier.

## Why Choose a Local Towing Service from Sollenau?

As a locally operating company since 2018, we know every kilometer of the A2 in the Wiener Neustadt and Baden area. Our base in Sollenau allows for immediate response. Unlike large corporations, with us you speak directly to the driver who is coming to you.

### Our Advantages:
*   **Fast Arrival:** Direct access to the A2.
*   **Languages:** Service in Polish, German, and English – no language barriers in a stressful situation.
*   **24/7 Availability:** Real round-the-clock duty, including holidays.
*   **Transparency:** Clear prices agreed upon before arrival.

## Service Comparison: Roadside Assistance vs. Towing

Customers often ask if they need towing or if on-site help is sufficient. Here is a short guide:

| Service | When to choose? | Example action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Roadside Assistance** | Minor fault, dead battery, flat tire | Jump start, wheel change, fuel delivery, minor electrical repairs |
| **Towing Service** | Serious engine/gearbox failure, accident, steering damage | Towing to base in Sollenau, partner workshop, or international transport |

### When is a Jump Start Sufficient?
If your car doesn't start after a stop, and the starter only clicks, the battery is likely dead. In this situation, our mobile service will arrive and start the car with a professional booster, also checking the alternator charging. This is a cheaper and faster option than towing.

## What to Prepare Before Calling for Help?

To help us reach you as quickly as possible, prepare the following information:
*   **Exact Location:** Kilometer number from the marker post (e.g., A2 km 34.5 direction Graz).
*   **Car Make and Model:** And color – it will be easier for us to spot you.
*   **Fault Description:** What happened? Are wheels locked? (Important for winching onto the truck).
*   **Number of Passengers:** Do you need transport for your family?
